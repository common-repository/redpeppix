Test PIXSETTING

Want to give it a try? Then go to the installation tab and install the pixoona plugin.
You can also sign up with http://www.pixoona.com free of charge. There you'll get more information about pixoona as a social network, as well as about your opportunities as a PIXSETTER. Share your life from within your images, set trends and earn money with your PIX-activities.

== Installation ==

Integrating the plugin to Wordpress is only possible, if the website is individually hosted, i.e. if it is on your own server.
To integrate PIX technology into a Wordpress blog, you must:

Step 1:  Choose „Plugins“ and then „Add new“ in your Wordpress backend. 
Step 2: Type „pixoona“ into the search. 
Step 3: Choose „pixoona Plugin“ from the search results, then click „Install now“. The installation will take a few seconds.
Step 4: Choose „Activate“ on the page that opens after installation. 


PIX settings

Settings for PIXSETTING on your blog can be made in the pixoona plugin on your blog or in your pixoona backend. Both systems are synchronous, settings are transferred automatically.

The following settings can be chosen:
a. PIXSETTER-Community: You decide if only you are allowed to set PIX on your blog or if you release the PISETTTING function to other PIXSETTERs.
b. PIX-delay: When you release the PIXSETTING you can define if you want to have a delay of 24 hours. In your pixoona backend you get an overview of all PIX set which you can release or delete. After 24 hours the PIX is published automatically.
c. PIX-scope on your blog: Define if you want to allow PIXSETTING on your whole blog, or if you want to limit it to your posts and comments.
